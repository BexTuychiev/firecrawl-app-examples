Smog is a tank hero with an incredible health pool, and a fast firing, but inaccurate machine gun. His under barrel grenade launcher is an effective tool when he is outranged. His health recovery perks allow him to be a great support/ meat shield character.

[Smog's Lore posted by JK Eff on Discord on 2020-11-18 \| Written by byeimhi and Ziggie](https://discord.com/channels/520268917659402241/703180906696933387/778651166598103110)

Samuel Haze was a welder with a wife and two kids. Molten metal, fire and sparks were kind of his things since forever. But when construction jobs in his area dried up, only the local circus would need his services often enough to provide him with the means to live. The circus people also became a second family to him, supporting him in times of need. Only both his families could make him laugh - while they were still there. A raging fire that started with a single spark took away all Samuel’s circus friends and his only job - and the worst was that he was there, but failed to save anyone but himself.

The second fire took only half an hour to ravage his house and kill his wife and kids. Strangely, Samuel started to laugh more often after that. But his laugh only scared people.

With the best intentions, he started to help the local fire department. Soon he was trusted enough to go anywhere within the building. It was by chance that he saw a check report on his house - and learned that the safety of his family was neglected to cut costs and steal money on the government level. Incredulous of the scale of the scheme, he confronted the team. They never tried to defend themselves. Before Samuel could finish, he felt a blow to the back of his head, and everything went black.
