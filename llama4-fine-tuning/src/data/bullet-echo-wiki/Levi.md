[Levi's Lore posted by JK Eff on Discord on 2021-04-27 \| Written by Animatd](https://discord.com/channels/520268917659402241/703180906696933387/836635173726584852)

Explosions can be heard coming from the battlefield. A smoke screen arises as bullets fly. A middle-aged man, the general, observes the fight from above, with a massive woman next to him. Her face turns into an evil sneer, “She's overconfident, she’s going to lose. Your daughter isn’t fit for this...”. The general sighs, “Bertha, it’s over... let us end this...”. Bertha laughs not shifting her eyes from the battlefield, “I thought she’d last longer, I...”. The general interrupts her with a furious roar, “Enough! I have tolerated your jealousy long enough, she will succeed. I meant us... we’re done”. Bertha's face turns grim and then eerily calm as she looks at him. “You will regret this”, she turns and walks away.

Down below, the smoke clears, and two teams of three can be seen on opposite sides of the battlefield. Bullet holes and cracks mottle the stone pillars and barriers put up for training. One team, the blues, is holding their position. On the other side, three in green are separating, fanning out, left, middle and right. The one on the right arrives first to draw their attention, but the team is ready and shoots him before he can react. It is a trap, they were moving back-to-back as a unit. With one enemy down, they fall into a triangle formation with two in front and one in back and advance. When another green assaults them head-on, the two in front duck, and the blue in the back puts a shot between the green’s eyes. “Levi, come out and play,” taunts the blue in the back, and the team falls into a single file and retreats backwards to a stone wall, covering all angles. A shape can be seen running to the right, the blues all aim that way; the shape runs left, and the blues’ weapons follow.

The blue in the middle begins to sweat and the one in the back gulps. Silence. A bullet hole in the wall behind them shows the green setting sights through her scope. “Too easy,” she pulls the trigger, and bullets fly through the ready bullet hole in the stone ripping through the three in the line. As the three blues go down, a flare goes up and turns into the word ‘Congratulations’. The green takes off her mask to reveal Levi with a vibrant smile on her face. The blues walk up and jeer, “Good game huh Lev? We thought we had you.” “Not a chance, twinkle toes,” retorts Levi. She looks up at the general who smiles with pride. He nods.

Later that week, at the graduation ceremony, 11 soldiers are standing in a semi-circle. They are facing the general who is holding a case with twelve vials. The general first congratulates everyone on their achievements and then starts to explain the next step in their almost lifelong training. They are the famed and secret night owls, elite super soldiers, assassins, and spies, already at the top of their game. Each vial holds a serum of nanites that will merge with their bodies turning them into the ultimate champions. At this, a roll of thunder booms and a lightning lights up the skies outside. It reveals a shadow on a hill close to the complex. Lighting flashes again to show Bertha with her machine gun and scores of figures in black. “I found someone better!” Her machine gun is revving up and... BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM!

Bertha unloads explosive rounds on the complex, and as the mini explosions rip through the foundation, screams of terror rise above the din. Personnel not killed at once is being crushed by falling debris during escape from the building. It is a massacre. Bertha is emotionless as she expends thousands of explosive rounds into the complex. The building is almost razed to the ground, the smoke is thick. It covers the pile of bodies where the soldiers stood before. There is movement, and a hand appears from within the pile. As Levi struggles to get free of the bodies, she flashes back to the moment the explosive rounds came through the wall, exploded the windows, and sent glass flying at unfathomable speeds.

As glass went flying, a long shard flew straight into Levi’s face. Her dodge was not quick enough to prevent the shard from ripping her eye out and sending her tumbling to the ground, blood gushing from her eye. “Protect Levi, everyone! NOW!” Reacted immediately the general, and the remaining soldiers launched themselves at her to become a shield. As they piled on her, the bullets began to tear through their bodies. The shot general fell dead beside, dropping the case with nanities.

Wincing from the pain in the injured eye, Levi pushes herself up to see her friends and comrades all dead. She sees her father’s body and stumbles over before falling to her knees. Levi begins to weep when she hears the sound of approaching footsteps. Quickly composing herself, she hides behind debris. As the footsteps get closer, she looks at her father one last time and notices the case... If she could get it, she would be able to heal and survive. Gritting her teeth, she runs for the case. Levi counts the steps to her goal until her pain becomes unbearable, and she stumbles. Powering through the pain, she continues, 25 steps, 15 steps. Bertha walks in through the clearing smoke and also aims for the case, setting up her machine gun, just as Levi slides in, grabs the case and turns to run. Bertha’s machine gun fire clips Levi’s heel as it follows her mad dash to cover. Levi stops only in the cover of a wall and opens the case, but before she can grab a vial, bullets begin tearing through the wall and hit the case sending all the vials flying. As Levi attempts to jump and catch one, the new pain from her heel delays her, and the vials begin crashing to the ground. Shaking off the pain, she dives, catching the last one before it hits the ground. She scrambles to her feet on the run as bullets rip through the spot she was just in. She doesn’t get far when she trips and falls, with the fire path following her just inches away. But the machine gun suddenly chokes on the hiss of steam and stops. “Reloading!” Yells Bertha, and Levi looks with astonishment right at her, through a bullet hole in the stone. Then she clenches her teeth and stabs the serum in her leg. As the serum enters her blood, the wounds begin to heal, and she feels better.

But something is off, the nanites are accumulating in her right eye after fixing her body wounds. She realizes they are creating an eye for her, and the pain goes away, her sight is returning, and then she can see much more - right through the wall. “Cool,” she chuckles. The machine gun behind the wall is starting up again. Levi perks up and disappear into the storm at an incredible speed.

Bertha leads three teams in the foremost squad. Moving through the building rubble, she pulls out a radar, scans the surrounding area and sees the running red prints in the top right corner of the screen. She stops and says, “She’s here”. A shape can be seen running to the right and the company all turns their aim that way. The shape dashes to the left, and all scopes follow it. “So predictable”, says Levi as she appears out of the shadows behind one of the soldiers in the back. His scream echoes in the distance, and the company begins to get nervous. As the soldiers look around, a bolt of lightning strikes and thunder can be heard in the raging storm. Two of the company next to the taken soldier drop dead. “I didn’t sign up for this! This was supposed to be easy!” A soldier screams before dropping his weapon and running away. “Pew pew..”. The soldier gets a bullet in each knee on the run and falls to the ground in agony. The remaining soldiers crowd around Bertha covering all directions. “Retreat, this is her playground.” Bertha says wearily. When they move away in retreat, Levi can be seen standing over one of the soldiers she killed. She grabs their gun, removes the scope, throws away their gun, and adds the scope to hers. Then follows the remaining soldiers and the traitor Bertha.

As the sun rises, it warms Levi standing with one foot on Bertha’s machine gun and looking at Bertha’s badge of medals on the ground. Levi looks back at the horizon and sighs. Then she rips off a piece of her sleeve and wraps it around her head, hiding her right eye and deactivating her enhanced vision.
