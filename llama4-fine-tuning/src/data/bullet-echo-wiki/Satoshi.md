[Satoshi's Lore posted by JK Eff on Discord on 2021-06-29 \| Written by Olga Lebedenko](https://discord.com/channels/520268917659402241/703180906696933387/859462123092443166)

Satoshi Iwasaki was a son of the famous Japanese industrialist five minutes short of a millionaire who sponsored and curated Bullet Echo. His mother died in childbirth, and Satoshi became the only reminder of her for his father.

From childhood, he was a precocious boy - he studied shooting, went in for sports with his personal trainer hired by his father, but did not study at school, attending home lessons instead. Young Satoshi had no friends, and how could he make them, being under the constant supervision of his parent and bodyguards?!

Mr. Iwasaki took care of everything for his growing son except for his communication with peers. He himself did not pay much attention to Satoshi, wanting nothing more than that he grows up a well-mannered person and doesn’t bring shame to his father in society. All their conversations were rather short and concerning only the training process and its results. It was in his own family that Satoshi first felt... lonely. He did not know what he felt for his father, but it was clearly not a son's love for his parent. More like respect. A subordinate’s respect for the boss, nothing more. Sometimes the boy even thought about what would have happened if his mother remained alive. Would she have been kinder than his father? Would she have treated him better than he did? And most importantly, would he have been as "subordinate" to her as to his father?

On his 16th birthday, Satoshi received a katana - Iwasaki family relic - as a gift. He kept is a great treasure and even began to master it bit by bit, which indescribably pleased his father, who saw a worthy successor of his status in his son, the bearer of his blood.

But he failed to save Satoshi from trouble.

The boy's life was almost cut short by an accident. At the initiative of one of the spiteful critics of the family, an explosive device was planted in Iwasaki’s country house where Satoshi and his father were supposed to go. The explosion came all of a sudden and was very intense. It damaged the supporting structures and the building began to collapse rapidly, but the worst thing was that Satoshi happened to be close to the bomb at the time, and he was severely injured. His legs were torn off, and his arm was damaged. One of his bodyguards was killed by a falling facade piece. Another, having escaped with a broken arm, managed to call the rescue services and to report the incident to Mr. Iwasaki. The alarmed father instantly rushed to the scene and was confronted with a terrible sight: a ruined mansion, lots of wounded and dead staff, and the worst thing - his only son, half-conscious, bleeding out and quietly moaning through his teeth.

Satoshi was rushed to the hospital and spent a long time in intensive care, and even longer in recovery treatment. But he could no longer live the same life. He ended up in a wheelchair, and the prospects for returning to a healthy, active life were catastrophically few.

On return home, Skytech Megacorp’s future fighter felt with all his being how deeply his father mourned him. It was like he had died as far as his father was concerned, although he continued to communicate with Satoshi and even inquired about his mental state...

Satoshi had already begun to realize that most likely he would be permanently chained to a wheelchair, but he did not stop training and learning. Even being in a wheelchair, he continued to practice shooting. But he had to forget about active sports. Junior Iwasaki wanted his father to be proud of him all the same, and did not want to fail him further…

An offer of help came unexpectedly. And most importantly, from those that no one expected it from. The leaders of the Skytech Megacorp faction offered Mr. Iwasaki Sr. to treat his son and to implant new experimental prostheses which were supposed to completely replace the lost limbs. But in return, as payment, they wanted the boy to join the Arenas to be able to monitor the condition of his prostheses and, so to speak, for the purity of the experiment. The proposal sounded great on the one hand, but absolutely unacceptable and terrible on the other. The father wanted his son to walk again, but the price was too high. And the prospect of allowing them to make an experimental rat out of his only child seemed unacceptable to him. But in the end, Mr. Iwasaki made up his mind.

When Satoshi was taken to the laboratory of one of the most powerful and technologically advanced factions in the world, he did not know what fate awaited him. The prostheses took to his body well, and soon he was able to not only walk and run, but also to continue his sports training.

Very soon the joy of returning to a former lifestyle was replaced by the horror of learning the truth. His father did not tell him anything at all about the price he agreed to and that Satoshi had to pay. The only person Satoshi trusted actually betrayed him.

Despite it all, Satoshi very soon became one of the best fighters of the faction. He did not form any close ties with his allies though, and this cemented his image as a cold-hearted killer…
