[Hurricane's Lore posted by JK Eff on Discord on 2020-10-05 \| Written by ZeptoLabs](https://discord.com/channels/520268917659402241/703180906696933387/762670525977460776)

A pretty woman has brought Hurricane to the Arenas. And he didn’t even know her name.

In his former life, you wouldn’t have looked twice at Harold Kane: just another office slave in a slightly crumpled suit on his way to another day in a tiny cubicle. Unimaginative job, a sad old dog in a small apartment, no close family or friends. But that was the outside. Inside burned a great passion.

For many years now, Kane was an ardent gamer, and he played only one game. It was a tactical shooter, and it occupied all his free hours. To say that he was good at it would be an understatement. He was one of the best! And also most mysterious: even though the real-life identity of player Hurricane was not a secret to those who were eager to spend money and time to establish it, he wouldn’t accept any offers, contracts or friendships.

Let’s go back to that day: Harold was in the office, and since it was quiet, he was playing. He did have a strict rule not to play at work, and he did adhere to it. Usually. But the new maps were unveiled in the morning, and since he couldn’t call in sick, he decided to take a peek at them at work. Just a peek. And then a test run. Those were great, he really needed to scout them more. All this time, he was oblivious to whatever happened around him.

What happened was a new intern, a pretty girl. And the head of the department, a sadistic mean bully that hardly ever graced the office ‘peasants’ floor with his presence. He took a liking to the girl in the elevator and decided to follow her. The intern wasn’t impressed either with his looks, position or offers, so he was in a foul mood. Chance made him pass by Kane’s cubicle and spot the screen.

If Kane was just fired, we wouldn’t have a story now. He was dragged to an unknown site, given an old shotgun and left alone. The following night was a nightmare, but he survived. He had to survive this way again and again. His boss decided that if he wanted playing, he could continue playing - so he sold out Kane to become one of the lab rats in weapon testing (good thing the corporation dealt in so many areas). It was Sterling who spotted and singled out Kane, badly mauled by that time. Some things were patched, some replaced with high-tech gear. All to fight again and again, over and over. But Hurricane doesn’t really mind.
