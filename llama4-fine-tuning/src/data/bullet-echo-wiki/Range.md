A hero's fire range is the radius of their aim cone or the top of their shadow to the end of their aim cone.

This shouldn't confused with projectile range which is the distance a projectile can travel.

A [consumables](https://bullet-echo.fandom.com/wiki/Consumables "Consumables") such as ammo, armour, upgrades etc... are approximately 42 units of range wide.

Gear, scope, and abilities can modify a hero's range.
