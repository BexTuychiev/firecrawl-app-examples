_Doc's assault rifle may not be very powerful, but it comes with a mounted grenade launcher that can hit enemies from a great distance._

...

**Doc** is a hero in Bullet Echo belonging to the [P.Y.R.O.](https://bullet-echo.fandom.com/wiki/Factions/PYRO "Factions/PYRO") faction. His play revolves heavily around his first passive, taking advantage of his large health pool to activate it. He does well in teams especially, though his Grenade Launcher must be used with caution. While his damage isn't very good, his aim and range improve on taking damage, meaning that you'll do well against other long-range heroes who don't have Doc's health advantage.

Doc can be unlocked by opening crates.

[Doc's Lore posted by JK Eff on Discord on 2020-09-08 \| Written by Roamer](https://discord.com/channels/520268917659402241/703180906696933387/752875840064323584)

Captain Ray Harris of the United States Medical Corps was a capable physician, serving as a combat medic for several years before being severely injured on one of his tours of duty, receiving some burns to his face after an encounter with an incendiary grenade. He retired from the battlefield and instead was sent to be a physician on a panel tasked with testing new armaments before they were considered for use by the army.

In his new job, Doc saw horrible new weapons, most of them designed by Skytech, that he knew should never see use against human beings... nonetheless, many of these weapons did make it to the field. Doc's breaking point came when a new type of incendiary weapon was developed and sent to be inspected by the panel. Skytech, being the creators of this new devastating new type of ammunition, saw it fit to test it on live human subjects, selected from their many indentured servants. Despite his many objections, the test went without a hitch, and Doc saw firsthand how devastating this new weapon could be. The explosive rounds were tested for direct impact and close-range detonation, leaving just one of the test subjects still in one piece. After the trials, Doc felt that it was his moral imperative to see what he could do to ease the peoples' pains.

When he went to inspect the bodies, he came across the one living test subject, a man named Freddie. He was covered in burns and scars, and was in pitiful condition. He likely had just hours to live. Doc decided at that moment that he would attempt to save the man's life. He took Freddie from the testing area in secret and transported him to a hospital, where he personally performed a surgery that would save Freddie's life. Though the incident resulted in nerve damage and permanent burns, Doc was able to restore motor function and fix most of the life-threatening issues.

Shortly after this, Doc decided to quit the panel and the military all together, instead joining the Pyro faction along with Freddie and donning his trademark gas mask as a homage to all those that died or were injured due to devastating new weapons of war like he had.

### Mentioned in Sparkle's Lore\[ [Sign in to edit](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fbullet-echo.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FDoc%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D12&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

[Sparkle's Lore with Doc as honorable mention by Fahad "foxmindedguy" Kazi on Discord on 2021-10-12](https://discord.com/channels/520268917659402241/703180906696933387/819927443556794388)

She sat quietly in a small conference room across the table from two peculiar figures - one wearing a gas mask and the other hooked up to an oxygen tank. Every time her line of sight would meet theirs, she would quickly look away nervously. Her knee too was shaking constantly ever since she first took a seat.

"Ms. Visser, you have nothing to be afraid of", said the man in the gas mask. His voice sounded genuine and calming.

"Femke... You can call me by my first name... Femke", she spoke, clearing her throat between the statements.

"Alright, Femke. Please tell us how can we help you", replied the gas mask man once more before relaxing back on his chair with arms folded, waiting to listen to her story.

"I work...", she paused briefly before correcting herself, "worked at the Hope Orphanage. There, I used to teach children carpentry and spray painting to get their minds off the stresses of their predicament. I wanted to show them that they were all extremely talented, and that they could build, be creative, no matter what life threw at them. Adoption rates were slow but we were finding good homes for these children, so they could be loved and cared for. Until our CEO signed a contract with Unity Incorporated. This organization claimed that nuclear family was no longer a necessity for striving kids but instead children needed strong mentors to build their confidence and character. It was an academy of sorts - a boarding school or a summer camp, if you will. I was a bit skeptical about this program but if it could better the lives of these poor orphans who felt finding a parent was a competition and would constantly endure getting passed up until they were chosen, then I was not going to say anything…

...Within a week, their people came in droves and took all the kids who wanted to leave with them. Things seemed great for a little while until I was visited by a strange teenager named Felipe Garcia. This child had hollow eyes and would not speak. He left a note with me that had the address of one of the facilities of Unity Incorporated. The letter also instructed me to go unannounced. And that is exactly what I did".

She continued after taking a sip of water from the glass cup in front of her, "I saw... Children strapped down with needles and syringes in various places of their body... Some emerged in flooded containers of what appeared to be a breathable fluid... Other horrors I can't even describe".

As she recalled what else she witnessed, she grew quiet and started to slightly fidget uncomfortably.

"Carry on, Ms. Visser", said the man in the gas mask; leaning forward in interest and anticipation.

"As I stood there, frozen in disbelief and completely shocked at what we had unknowingly allowed - a guard noticed my presence. I don't remember what happened next but when I came to - I had a shotgun in my hand, probably the guards, and the entire work crew in that vicinity laid on the floor with their guts splattered everywhere", she uttered before going silent again. Her eyes withdrawn and her head anchored downward in shame.

"Sparkle!", yelled the guy with the oxygen tank to snap her out of the guilt-ridden dark place where she seemed to be headed.

"Excuse me?", said Femke, a little confused about the word.

"Please do not mind Freddie", interjected the gas mask man, "He has gone through something really terrible, which makes it difficult for him to speak, and sometimes he blurts out words uncontrollably".

"That's alright", nodded Femke in acknowledgment at Freddie's remark.

"So, Ms. Visser, how can we help you?", asked the gas mask man once more.

"I need your protection. I read that P.Y.R.O. specializes in handling tricky situations like mine. Unity Incorporated is after me because I am a threat, I know the crimes they have committed, and I can leak it to the world. But who would believe me... I am a mass murderer and any person in my position would make up any story to protect themselves. However, I also have all the children they were experimenting on, and they are after them as well. Now I don't care much about whether I live or die - I just don't want these precious souls to get hurt further", demanded Femke with a surety in her voice that was largely absent through their past conversation.

After a brief moment of pause, the gas mask man took off his mask to reveal his face and then said, "I can do you one better. How would you like to join P.Y.R.O. and together we can take on Unity Incorporated - decimating them from the face of this planet for all their misdeeds".

He then looked towards Freddie and proceeded to say to Femke, "And I suppose your call-sign can be Sparkle; for you have always been the glimmer of hope in the lives of the children under your wing".
