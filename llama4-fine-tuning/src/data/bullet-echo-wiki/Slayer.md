- Use your bandages to decrease your movement loudness and travel around stealthily.
- When using thermal, activate it facing away from your target so that you have time to aim before shooting, reducing the likelihood of missing significantly.
- When looking around, turn slow enough to maintain aimed stance—especially during thermal. Controlling yourself rather than erratically turning towards enemies often makes the difference between you missing the shot and dying, or you getting the kill.
- Be aware of your surroundings when thermaling; high density objects may prevent you from getting the kill when you shoot.
- Take advantage of good thermal spots around the map, such as spawn points or a corner in a building, which gives you time to react to intruders.
- Don't go towards the middle too much, as there's usually a lot of action going on there, and you might get caught in the crossfire. Instead, pick off survivors and wait for your teammates.

[Slayer's lore posted on discord by JK Eff on 2021-06-01 \| Written by Fahad "foxmindedguy" Kazi](https://discord.com/channels/520268917659402241/703180906696933387/849294576920559626)

**Name:** Faaris Imamović

**Age:** 32

**Place of Birth:** Sarajevo, Bosnia

Born in wealth and set to inherit the lucrative Drvo Ulje Incorporated, Faaris never had his heart in corporate dealings. Despite having a knack for academics and topping his class consistently, he always looked forward to rich folk sports like archery and hunting. He enjoyed the thrill of waiting patiently in one place for hours to avail the opportune moment when his game would walk into his cross-hair for their inevitable death.

It was because of this passion that Faaris took a break from his corporate duties and enlisted in the Spetsnaz Service. Soon after, he was called for a covert mission in a neighboring country to hunt down a defector who was leaking Bosnian secrets and defense information. He persevered and received a medal of honor for taking down the target along with his two bodyguards in a single shot, behind enemy lines near an abandoned plush toy factory. He also received the award of precision for escaping the premise unscathed and undetected with minimal casualties.

When Faaris returned to his family manor, he found the massacred remains of his parents in the drawing-room. He immediately alerted his younger brother to the situation, who arrived at the scene with several guards...to apprehend Faaris for the alleged murder of the late Drvo Ulje Incorporated owners; claiming avarice as the motive behind the action. At that moment, Faaris learned the true nature of his greedy sibling, who had plotted the entire series of events to acquire the family's fortune for himself by locking Faaris out with the slayer rule.

During the altercation that followed, Faaris had to rely on his army pistol to subdue all that attempted to take him down. He left the vicinity with a few more deaths to his name and a nasty scar that ran across the right side of his face.

Overnight, the war hero had turned fugitive in the eyes of the law, with darkness being his only refuge in his homeland. It was then that the Force & Arms faction found him. Since he had experienced the consequences of avarice first-hand, Faaris began to set up camp with his trusty sniper rifle in the various unseen corners of the metropolis to enact swift justice on whoever deserved it. It is said that wherever there’s even a whiff of his scent, bodies lay waste, all with a bullet hole in the skull and all are later found to have some link to corruption and cruelty. He is known as the Slayer among the urban gossipers and not many know what he looks like. However, his piercing eyes and a face covered by a red bandana can be seen in the countless graffiti on the walls of the back alleys and through-streets of the city.
