- Canceling the blink ability while you're still in mid air will instantly sends you to the ground exactly where you cancel, use it to your advantage
- The blink ability will create an audio around its landing point to alert enemies, but activating blink ability then cancel it before it casted will still played an audio, used to trick and fool the enemy
- Fight or Flight: The blink ability can be used to jump into a battle or escaping from one. Used it wisely
- Hug the enemy: Arnie's shotgun can miss a couple pellets, to counter it get as close as possible to the enemy to deal a full damage
- Circling around the enemy: Moreover hugging the enemy. if the enemy takes more than one shot moving in circle around them can make them struggles to follow your movement giving just enough time to fire another shot to finish them

recommendations

1. use jump to get closer to enemy, if you do any of the enemies except bastion and other shields won't work on you

2\. try not to get caught of the crossfire in snipers, at long distance Arnie is helpless

3\. if a character is running at you, use your jump on them and start attacking first

4\. if you are ambushed use jump to run away

\- This is your craziest idea, Stalker.
\- This is my best idea, Sterling.

Long, long ago there was no Wall. Then the Wall appeared, but certain people refused to let it stop their business. When machinery and technics all failed to solve the problem, the cartels returned to the basics - people. A mix of selective breeding and supportive tech appliances created El Saltadores, dynasties of couriers with the ability to go over the Wall.

As the stronger neighbor started to decline, the Wall became penetrable to all. Maybe it is good that this happened after Arnie built a house and raised a family on his illegal tripsâ€™ earnings. The system would have never let him go otherwise. He no more had to fear that his family would be caught in the cartelsâ€™ wars or that his only son would also have to risk his life on every crossing. El Saltadores were over.

On the wedding day of his youngest daughter, Arnie got drunk in the company of his new relatives. The one last thing he wished for now was his sonâ€™s wedding, he proclaimed. A great son he had, not like your scoundrels and addicts. A neat, affectionate boy with no love for whores and booze.

â€˜Well, donâ€™t mind it if we wonâ€™t come to that wedding, weâ€™re not so hot on cheering on two grooms!â€™.

â€˜Yeah, all but you know by now that your son is not a real man!â€™.

Even in his memories, everything after that was obscured in a flash of hot white fury. His fists hitting out, his sonâ€™s scared eyes, his wifeâ€™s silent nod, the punch-punch-punch on the doorâ€¦ Which door was that? He didnâ€™t remember that.

He had no son after that. His house became the most miserable place, because he never failed to remind his wife and daughters that it was all their fault. So his daughters stopped visiting, and his wifeâ€¦ His wife didnâ€™t wake up one day. He hadnâ€™t put two and two together until he found a letter from his sonâ€™s boyfriend in her purse. His son died a week before.

How can one turn back time? How can one say sorry to the people that are no longer there? It was too late, and he was completely powerless to change things.

\- Heâ€™s not stable. Heâ€™s off his head on peyote most of the time!
\- Thatâ€™s his only way to get a glimpse of his son and wife and say Sorry. And he really believes in those ghosts! We just need to switch him to that thing you mentioned a while ago. It was that one that gave me the idea. I have tracked down this last of El Saltadores last year in hopes of getting one for our team - for I have seen them in action when my gang used to deal with cartels from the other side. Those jumpers were not just that, they were trained to sneak, track and fight. He didnâ€™t agree to join, and I gave up on him. But now that I have something like this on offer... he wonâ€™t say no.
\- Trueâ€¦ Thatâ€™s a deal, Stalker. You get Arnie and his shotgun. I get her.
