## Tips\[ [Sign in to edit](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fbullet-echo.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FGhost%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D9&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

- Always become invisible if you feel you've entered an open area or a dangerous place of the map
- DO NOT reveal yourself in front of an, after revealing yourself you have a short cooldown before you can shoot and the enemy can quickly attack you after you reveal yourself. If you want to reveal yourself, stay out of sight like behind walls or behind the enemy
- Use your Stim and Invisibility at the same time to create an insane speed
- Do not go near your allies when invisibles. If you and your allies encountered an enemy the enemy will shoot at your allies. If you stay near to your allies you will have a high chance of getting hit and be revealed especially high pierce hero
- Watch out for [Raven](https://bullet-echo.fandom.com/wiki/Raven "Raven"), [Cyclops](https://bullet-echo.fandom.com/wiki/Cyclops "Cyclops"), [Levi](https://bullet-echo.fandom.com/wiki/Levi "Levi"), and [Slayer](https://bullet-echo.fandom.com/wiki/Slayer "Slayer"), their Scan and Thermal ability can reveal you when invisible
- Do an early attack, pick an ammo and quickly go to the other player/team's spawn and surprise them. Understanding bullet echo maps and knowing spawn locations can help you a lot for doing an early attack. But its not quiet recommended due your low health you can rush to the enemy and mostly only killing 1 enemy and then died

[Ghost's Lore posted by JK Eff on Discord on 2020-12-28 \| Written by](https://discord.com/channels/520268917659402241/703180906696933387/793047178641539082) Dream979

Ghost was born in a land-locked country where violence was the norm. Citywide showdowns and gang wars were commonplace in his neighborhood. A Corrupt Government was ruining the Country while The Terrorist groups were trying to control it, Worst Environment to grow up in. To work normally and earn money was totally impossible for Ghost and his family. He could not grow properly because of malnutrition and the scarcity of food.

In his teens, he joined a local gang and started doing robberies. He started hanging out with dangerous people. After some time, he started using firearms. He became a master of SMG because it was lightweight, and he could easily run around fast with it. Because of his unique fight tactics, he became very popular. The Renegades noticed him soon. They offered him good pay and promised him invisibility. First, he thought that the invisibility part wasn't true but after an experiment, he became a Superhuman. With his Invisibility and fast speed he quickly became one of the best fighters in the arenas. His Invisibility gave him the name GHOST. He quickly got promoted to higher ranks and today is known as one of the most dangerous fighters.
