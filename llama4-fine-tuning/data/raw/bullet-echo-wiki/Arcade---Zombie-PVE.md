## Stage Objectives/Tasks\[ [Sign in to edit](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fbullet-echo.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FArcade_-_Zombie_PVE%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D2&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

On some stages (or to be precise, stage 2, 4, and 6,) players will be given 1 out of 4 different objectives/task to completes. Players needs to complete the objectives each in under 2:30 minutes. If the times runs and players failed to complete the objective then the infecteds will become insanely fast, making the stage almost impossible to win. There are 4 objectives, which include:

#### Escorting a Survivor:\[ [Sign in to edit](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fbullet-echo.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FArcade_-_Zombie_PVE%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D3&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

Players will be tasked to escort a survivor to a train. The survivor will spawn in a chamber somewhere on the map, and the players need to go to the chamber location, the survivor will spawn/released from the chamber once a player go near it. Players need to be in a range of the survivor to make the survivor starts moving towards the railway, otherwise it will not move, more players that in the range of the survivor will make the survivor moves faster. The survivor has the ability to provide heals, and armor to itself and all players in the range of the survivor. The survivor has a health and when the survivor ran out of health it will be downed and players will able to revive them. A train will spawn at the railway (near the player's spawns) once the survivor is close and will able to evacuate

#### Collect Samples:\[ [Sign in to edit](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fbullet-echo.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FArcade_-_Zombie_PVE%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D4&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

Several samples will spawn around the map (mostly on the edge of the map) in a form of loot, all players needs to collect all samples that were indicated before the time runs out. The amount of samples that will spawn is determined by the amount of players in the lobby, at max (4 players) 5 samples will spawn, but less players in the lobby will decrease the amount of samples need to be collected.

#### Destroy Infected Nests:\[ [Sign in to edit](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fbullet-echo.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FArcade_-_Zombie_PVE%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D5&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

Bombs will spawn (2 at max) at a players spawns or near the railway. Players need to pick up the bomb and plant it in an infected nests indicated somewhere on the map. The amount of infected nests and bombs is determined by the amount of players in the lobby, if there are 3-4 players in the lobby then the players need to plant 2 bombs and, if there 1-2 players then players only need to plant 1 bomb.

#### Kills Special Infecteds:\[ [Sign in to edit](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fbullet-echo.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FArcade_-_Zombie_PVE%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D6&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

A group of Special Infecteds will spawn on different parts of the map and players need to kill all of them. The special infecteds consist of Driller/Digger Infected, Charger Infected, and Brute Lightning Infected, however they're all will gain a buff, making them harder to defeat than regular Special Infecteds. At max (4 players) 5 Special Infecteds will spawn and will be reduced based on the amount of players in the lobby. However its not always bad because each of the Special Infecteds drop a Golden Crate once they died.
