She sat quietly in a small conference room, across the table from two peculiar figures—one wearing a gas mask and the other hooked up to an oxygen tank. Every time her line of sight would meet theirs, she would quickly look away nervously. Her knee had been shaking ever since she first took a seat.

"Ms. Visser, you have nothing to be afraid of," said the man in the gas mask. His voice sounded genuine and calming.

"Femke... You can call me by my first name... Femke," she spoke, clearing her throat between the statements.

"Alright, Femke. Please tell us how we can help you," replied the gas mask man once more before relaxing back on his chair with arms folded, waiting to listen to her story.

"I work..." she paused briefly before correcting herself, "worked at the Hope Orphanage. There, I used to teach children carpentry and spray painting to get their minds off the stresses of their predicament. I wanted to show them that they were all extremely talented and that they could build and be creative, no matter what life threw at them. Adoption rates were slow, but we were finding good homes for these children so they could be loved and cared for. Until our CEO signed a contract with Unity Incorporated. This organisation claimed that the nuclear family was no longer a necessity for striving kids, but instead children needed strong mentors to build their confidence and character. It was an academy of sorts—a boarding school or a summer camp, if you will. I was a bit sceptical about this program, but if it could better the lives of these poor orphans who felt finding a parent was a competition and would constantly endure getting passed up until they were chosen, then I was not going to say anything…

...Within a week, their people came in droves and took all the kids who wanted to leave with them. Things seemed great for a little while until I was visited by a strange teenager named Felipe Garcia. This child had hollow eyes and would not speak. He left a note with me that had the address of one of the facilities of Unity Incorporated. The letter also instructed me to go unannounced. And that is exactly what I did.".

She continued after taking a sip of water from the glass cup in front of her, "I saw... children strapped down with needles and syringes in various places of their bodies... Some emerged in flooded containers of what appeared to be a breathable fluid... Other horrors I can't even describe.".

As she recalled what else she witnessed, she grew quiet and started to slightly fidget uncomfortably.

"Carry on, Ms. Visser," said the man in the gas mask, leaning forward in interest and anticipation.

"As I stood there, frozen in disbelief and completely shocked at what we had unknowingly allowed—a guard noticed my presence. I don't remember what happened next, but when I came to, I had a shotgun in my hand, probably the guards, and the entire work crew in that vicinity lay on the floor with their guts splattered everywhere," she uttered before going silent again. Her eyes were withdrawn, and her head was anchored downward in shame.

"Sparkle!" yelled the guy with the oxygen tank to snap her out of the guilt-ridden dark place where she seemed to be headed.

"Excuse me?" said Femke, a little confused about the word.

"Please do not mind Freddie," interjected the gas mask man. "He has gone through something really terrible, which makes it difficult for him to speak, and sometimes he blurts out words uncontrollably.".

"That's alright," nodded Femke in acknowledgement at Freddie's remark.

"So, Ms. Visser, how can we help you?" asked the gas mask man once more.

"I need your protection. I read that P.Y.R.O. specialises in handling tricky situations like mine. Unity Incorporated is after me because I am a threat; I know the crimes they have committed, and I can leak it to the world. But who would believe me...? I am a mass murderer, and any person in my position would make up any story to protect themselves. However, I also have all the children they were experimenting on, and they are after them as well. Now I don't care much about whether I live or die—I just don't want these precious souls to get hurt further," demanded Femke with a surety in her voice that was largely absent through their past conversation.

After a brief moment of pause, the gas mask man took off his mask to reveal his face and then said, "I can do you one better. How would you like to join P.Y.R.O., and together we can take on Unity Incorporated—decimating them from the face of this planet for all their misdeeds"?

He then looked towards Freddie and proceeded to say to Femke, "And I suppose your call sign can be Sparkle, for you have always been the glimmer of hope in the lives of the children under your wing.".

In a conference room, Femke is nervously surrounded by two men wearing gas masks and an oxygen tank. She tells the man that she works at the Hope Orphanage, teaching children carpentry and spray painting to help them cope with their struggles. The CEO signed a contract with Unity Incorporated, an organization that aimed to build children's confidence and character through strong mentors. Femke was sceptical about this program but believed it could improve the lives of poor orphans.

Femke is visited by a teenager named Felipe Garcia, who leaves a note with the address of Unity Incorporated's facilities. She witnesses children being strapped down with needles and syringes, and other horrors. The gas mask man asks Femke to join P.Y.R.O., a group that specializes in handling tricky situations like hers. Femke is a mass murderer and wants to protect the children they experimented on. The gas mask man offers to help Femke join P.Y.R.O. and take on Unity Incorporated for their misdeeds. He suggests Femke's call sign be Sparkle, as she has always been a glimmer of hope in the lives of the children under her wing.
