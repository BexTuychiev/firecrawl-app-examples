- Heal in between your shots. This often makes the difference between who wins in a head on fight, especially when fighting other Mirages.
- You have a short window of time to redirect your jump after your breakaway. This can be used to quickly jump forward and sideways in the heat of a fight.
- You can cancel your jump in midair, use this to precisely control where you jump.
- Using your jump allows your shooting cooldown to reset. Combining this with jump canceling allows you to take a shot, jump cancel, and take another shot without getting damaged. Try to jump sideways to avoid getting hit after you land.
- Use corners to your advantage. You can peek at your enemy, get a shot, and go back behind cover, repeating this until they die or get too close.
- \[HARD\] If you use your heal right after you jump with the perfect timing, you can simultaneously heal and jump.

[Mirage's Lore posted by JK Eff on 2020-10-26 \| Written by Roamer](https://discord.com/channels/520268917659402241/703180906696933387/770307861225799730)

Mirage always liked to stand out, to have a little "pop." To step out of her family's shadow, and into her own as a sniper in her own right.

Hailing from a family of snipers that were part of the "old guard" of the Renegades, Mirage has a personality to match her favorite pop songs. Ever since her mother died, she had been pushed by her father to live up to the family tradition. He wanted her to practice the way of the sniper, becoming entirely invisible to hide, then strike the killing blow from the shadows... but that didn't fit Mirage's style.

She was a skirmisher, and she preferred running around the battlefield, ambushing her enemies in unorthodox ways. Her father became angry that she was doing this, shouting at her that she would miss all her shots, and that a sniper must lie in wait and always maintain pinpoint accuracy. What good is an ambush when you can't take out your opponent in just one shot? So he barred Mirage from running combat simulations, commanding her to work on a practice range until she was able to use a rifle properly.

She hated this. The bulky rifles were useless in a close-range fight, and she could forget about mobility with those things. After days of frustration and scorn from her father, she left the range and locked herself in the arsenal. There, she took down her mother's rifle and released it from its shroud... and she tore it apart, smashing it against the walls. The bolt was twisted, the barrel bent, and the stock in pieces. Parts of the sniper rifle littered the floor. Mirage stared at them, only realizing what she had done after her breakdown had ended... and then she began to rebuild. She took the salvageable parts and put them back together, using several spare parts from the vast collection of weaponry in the room. Eventually, she had created a brand-new rifle, light and easy to handle, that fit her style perfectly. Not yet knowing this would be her signature weapon, Mirage left the armory to face her father.
