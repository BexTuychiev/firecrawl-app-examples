Creates a Forcefield that blocks all damage from bullets with a lower [piercing power](https://bullet-echo.fandom.com/wiki/Density "Density") than the Forcefield's durability. Grenades and rockets cannot pass through Forcefields, though their explosions can, and rockets that directly hit it will disable the Forcefield. Any enemy that attempts to walk through the Forcefield will have their shooting disabled and will get a slowness debuff.

- Use the movement noise reduction from Bandages to get around undetected.
- You can use your shield to trap enemies, disabling their shooting and making them an easy target. This can also be done through walls, so be sure to take advantage of this against people camping in a spot. Also, if a Dragoon, Arnie or Mirage jumps on you, you can brutally assasisnate them.
- You have a brief window of time to change where your Forcefield will face after activating the ability. This is useful to quickly place down a shield behind you or to your side to protect against flankers.
- You can use your reload (and bandages) to temporarily disable your shooting, so you don't fire an accidental shot that gives your position away.

“Operation Husk” was a secret project that existed behind the scenes, until just a few months before the Arenas, when Skytech had finally struck gold in their hard work. Not much is known about this project, the only evidence pointing to its existence being through audio logs.

Log H-001 This is \[REDACTED\] speaking. I have finally received a green light from the upper branch members of Skytech. It seems my little project can finally receive its proper funding and materials. I’m excited to see what new heights this might reach for us here, especially with the ongoing faction war.

Log H-034 After several months of gathering the materials I would need, I finally found a volunteer. See, the theory is that by implanting a body part that holds some of the genetics and pure DNA of a subject, ideally the heart or brain, we are able to transfer their consciousness into a computer, hopefully even an automaton.

Log H-067 “Good morning sir! You must be \[.......\]. Glad you could make it.” “Pleasure to be here, \[REDACTED\].” \[Audio cut out\] “Ah, I see, so sorry to hear that. Since this may be your last interaction as a human, are there any last requests? I’d like to provide your new life or old one with a few last requests if you have any.” “Just one: Can you keep my memories of Warren?” “Who may that be?” “My pet fish. I got him as a child, and he’s still here while everyone else is gone. It’s like he’s immortal, but he’s dear to me.” “Will do, \[.......\]. The door to the extraction room is down the corridor. We thank you for your contribution to science today.”

Log H-106 It seems that the transplant was successful. However, the next challenge is preserving the heart. A colleague of mine told me to use a microorganism and nutrient diluted liquid, seeming as it endlessly produces the necessary compounds to keep the heart pumping. I’ll have to look into that. Anyways, I’ll have to look into giving this experiment a name. I can’t keep referring to this model as “Model B-107”

Log H-203 The production of the robotic parts are coming relatively smoothly. We decided on powering the robotics using magnetically levitating generators, which generate power based on the magnetosphere around Model B-107. The constantly rotating points located on this design generate power as it becomes repellent to the Earth’s gravitational pull. In addition, B-107 has parts made of lead, meaning unless the generators are damaged, the generators will follow it around like trained dogs on leashes.

Log H-300 Today marks the anniversary of this experiment. Model B-107 has finally been merged and has begun to generate power from the magnetosphere. To boost this property, we placed lead generators releasing a constant electric field in an effort to boost the magnetic power in this area. Soon, B-107 will walk around as the former husk of \[.......\]. That reminds me, its fish is still well and alive, even though we did forget to feed it on occasion, as if it was immortal. This might be a whole other experiment on its own.

Log H-567 We have decided to simply rename Model B-107 as Blot for convenience. We’ve decided that Blot has passed the test of sentience, and he does indeed have a conscience inside. Whether or not that is \[.......\] is unconfirmed. On other news, we have decided to give Blot an aimbot of sorts, to give him a purpose beyond basic menial chores. As of right now, we are perfecting a bolt action rifle, capable of killing any man. Remember, the only thing that can defeat Skytech technology...is Skytech technology.

_This was the last non-corrupted audio log left. It is speculated that there are plenty more left encrypted inside the Skytech data base. The author of these audio logs also seems to lack an identity, as if his existence simply disappeared. We did find plans to make Model B-107 an aquatic model as well as a citizen safe model, although we are unsure of what this entails. As of right now, B-107 is going by the alias of Blot and is fighting alongside Skytech inside the deadly Arenas, although this only makes discovering its plans more interesting._

As a Blot main, I agree. He is also underplayed so people have trouble countering him early on(although I still have players run headfirst into my barrier, while bots just stand there and look at me).

Blot's "Bolt Action Gun" is a one shot, also Force Field makes Blot pretty much invulnerable in a head to head fight and keeps Blot safe while waiting for recharge/aiming.
