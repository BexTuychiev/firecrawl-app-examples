## Snipers\[ [Sign in to edit](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fbullet-echo.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FClasses%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D1&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

The sniper class has access to Bandages as medical ability, which gives them a fast direct HP recovery and reduces the movement noise. They also have access to the Dark Predator gear set and contain the following characters: Firefly, Blot, Mirage, Slayer and Lynx. They use their extremely long range and high accuracy with high damage to eliminate targets from a distance, as they cannot really shoot fast in close quarters combat. (Exception: Firefly with his Sting passive.)
