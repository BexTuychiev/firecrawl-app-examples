[Bastion's Story posted by JK Eff on Discord on 2021-02-09 \| Written by Дат-Минь Нгуен](https://discord.com/channels/520268917659402241/703180906696933387/808699852556599306)

He used to be a guard, an ordinary man seen at the entrances of various buildings of the corporation. What was it that made him the man we know today? The fact that he followed his motto: ‘To live and to protect the lives of family and friends’. Не started working for the corporation to pay for his relatives’ treatments. He signed up for testing exoskeletons to save his best friend from the rumoured pain and danger to life. Unfortunately, those weren’t rumours but info leaks that caused some workers to get ‘fired’. The first hydraulic drive armor prototypes were failures to put it mildly. The way armor parts moved broke his bones, shattered joints and pierced his body. The blood from the wounds shortened the electrics. It could take several days to pry the armor off him. The scientists didn’t even expect the man that lost so much blood and was unconscious from the pain and internal bleeding to have a pulse. He managed to recover quickly though. Those 10 days of work, only 3 of them spent in a coma caused by this ‘work injury’, paid for his younger brother’s treatment.

He spent years in the experimental arms lab, keeping the corporation’s newest technologies a secret, to avoid being ‘fired’, to save his colleagues from taking his place. Armor maimed and crashed, shields failed and glitched and shut off the armor and even the minigun as a result. But when tests turned successful, the corporation got Bastion - a fighter tenacious like an armored tank, with the firepower of an armored tank, and ignoring the pain like a machine. Ignoring it out of necessity. He knew to be cautious on the battlefield, but he had no idea that his real enemies were fighting alongside him. Corporation’s mercenaries fought for money and for their own life, betrayed him at every opportunity, but every time the betrayer lost everything while Bastion survived. He regrets choosing the corporation. He regrets trusting fighters that did not deserve that trust. But he doesn’t regret protecting others. That choice always saved his life. He resisted joining the Arenas because despite the uselessness, stupidity, treachery and even touchiness of most mercenaries (he thought them to be mercenaries), his own brother was one of them, and he was set on repaying the debt. His brother was killed in a fight, and Bastion lost the last person he protected. He lost the meaning of his life.

It was then that he joined the Arenas. He was looking for death but found like-minded fighters, friends that were worthy of his protection. He gained the power to keep on protecting others, and he gained the will to keep on living.
