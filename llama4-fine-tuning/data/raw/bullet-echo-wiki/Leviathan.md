[Leviathan's Lore posted by JK Eff on Discord on 2020-11-30 \| Written by Loi(C)y](https://discord.com/channels/520268917659402241/703180906696933387/782921850694008865)

Igor Draginvich was born on the 20th of XX, XXXX in Tomsk, Siberia. His father took him on hunting trips in the wilderness, where Igor took his first bear down at 13, and scared off a pack of wolves at 16. In the place and time he grew up, one did not buy new things, one fixed old ones or made new things from whatever was on hand. This helped him later.

Igor‚Äôs country was already at war when he was drafted. His strength, hardiness and survival skills saved his life for several years. His engineering talents were first noted when he saved his platoon from obliteration by patching up their artillery guns over and over till reinforcements arrived. This got him transferred to the navy as an assistant engineer. In one of the battles, the famous turrets made from spare parts and scraps saved the ship and (most of) the crew. The reward, together with a prestigious order and a nickname Leviathan, included a leave in his native city to recuperate from shell-shock. This was where he unexpectedly died in his sleep and was buried in the eternally frosted ground.

Experiments on reviving frozen deadmen have been on for quite some time already, and rumours say that some actually succeeded. But no one really came forward to claim that they were revived this way. People overseeing such experiments would just say that it takes an exceptional person to succeed, and the success rate is so low it is almost not worth it.

Was information on Igor that good that they spent resources on finding his grave and trying to revive him? Definitely, since that territory is a tightly secured separate country with almost no contacts with the outside now. Was he that exceptional? Well, he was revived successfully. By whom? By someone who really wanted to give the Renegades a boost since he was ‚Äògifted‚Äô to them. Who knows though, with time he will catch up with the changes in the world and might make up his own mind about what he wants to do. And then no one would be able to stop him.
