Molly burrows underground and can move there for 5 sec. While underground, she does not see enemies, but constantly scans the space in a radius of **200** around her to reveal enemies above

When the ability ends, molly jumps out on the surface, dealing damage and disarming all enemies within a short radius for few seconds

If molly gets within a radius of any explosion while underground, she will be forced to the surface without applying disarm effect on the enemies around
