## Tips\[ [Sign in to edit](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fbullet-echo.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FStalker%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D11&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

Here are some tips to improve your gameplay

- Always become invisible if you feel you've entered an open area or a dangerous palace of the map
- DO NOT reveal yourself in front of an, after revealing yourself you have a short cooldown before you can shoot and the enemy can quickly attack you after you reveal yourself. If you want to reveal yourself, stay out of sight like behind walls or behind the enemy
- Use your Team healing to attack an enemy. Team healing reduced damage taken while its active
- Do not go near your allies when invisibles. If you and your allies encountered an enemy the enemy will shoot at your allies. If you stay near to your allies you will has a high chance of getting hit and be revealed especially high pierce hero
- Watch out for [Raven](https://bullet-echo.fandom.com/wiki/Raven "Raven"), [Cyclops](https://bullet-echo.fandom.com/wiki/Cyclops "Cyclops"), [Levi](https://bullet-echo.fandom.com/wiki/Levi "Levi"), and [Slayer](https://bullet-echo.fandom.com/wiki/Slayer "Slayer"), their Scan and Thermal ability can reveal you when invisible

ATTENTION! UNAUTHORIZED SYSTEM ENTRY! EMERGENCY DATA DESTRUCTION! GET AUTHORIZED TO CANCEL!

The man in front of the screen reached into the coat’s pocket, took out a key card and scanned it.

EMERGENCY DATA DESTRUCTION CANCELLED.. ENTERING THE SYSTEM.. AUTHORIZING.. AUTHORIZATION SUCCESSFUL

‘Are you sure it is what we need?’ asked the man behind. ‘My job is to find ‘what we need’,’ replied the figure at the table unemotionally. Fingers started flying over the keyboard.

REQUESTING SKYTECH DATA.. LOADING COMPLETE

Six files appeared on the screen. Two clicks with a mouse and one of the files opened: Serial number: #1 Echo model: R17D12 Code name: Stalker Height: 6,1 ft Weight: 275 lbs Modified mass weight: 55 lbs Nationality: US First name: Tim Last Name: Hunter

SEARCHING FOR EXTENDED FIGHTER DATA.. LOADING EXTENDED DATA FOUND: -stalker.doc -stalker.png

Another click with the mouse and the figure at the screen moved to the side to give the man behind a better view. ‘Here’s everything they have..’.

OPENING stalker.doc…

Echo model R17D12 is the first successful non-test specimen that passed all trials. This model’s averaged abilities make it universal and easy to control for ‘operators’ at the same time. It is known that Echo models are based on personalities that are fit to complete elementary and complicated tasks. ‘Stalker’ was chosen as during trials he showed the necessary talents required for a working clone and completing standard renegade tasks such as:

sabotage

guerilla war

suppression

assault.

The major flaw of this Echo is his penchant for material gain which in turn may affect completing tasks if the soldier finds the pay inadequate. But at the same time, it guarantees quality work if the reward is high.

Personal data

Tim Hunter was born in US, DOB is unknown. Medical testing estimates the age to be between 21 and 27, a more exact estimation is not possible due to prior modifications and biohacking.

Little is known about parents. Both were drug-addicts and unemployed. In a private interview, fighter stated that they died when he was a toddler. Since then, he was raised by his grandmother.

!ATTENTION!

It is not definitely known whether she was his real relative or simply took him in at the time.

Hunter believes that everything changed when his city suffered from many skirmishes and resources became very scarce. This prompted Tim to join a gang - the name is unknown, and Hunter refused to divulge it.

!ATTENTION!

This past can be seen in the second Echo kit: evidently, it was created according to the fighter’s preferences. It is also known that Tim uses the second model R17D12GS (Gangsta Stalker) for assaults and aggressive tasks where agility is the priority.

The years in the gang honed Tim’s fighter skills. It was back then that he took a liking to Kalashnikov for easy use.

!ATTENTION!

Personal preference: taped double magazines for his AK.

As Tim recalls, his first killing happened when a wounded gang member asked him to finish up the soldier that he hit. For food and ammo. This was when Hunter’s main trait - greed - played up. The soldier was killed at once, and Tim rejoiced at the ‘bounty’.

Some years later, when the gang gained repute and the fighter gained acclaim, the gang leaders decided to dabble in politics. But their expectations have not been met. Under the reign of the superiors in power the gang members turned into puppets doing the dirty work on bidding. They received no power or respect for this, and this killed the morale, the members and the gang’s aspirations. Tim did not like this. Giving it some thought, he decided that he can’t go on like this.

He left the gang and went underground. As Stalker said, it was similar to being a wind; when you can’t harm others and others can’t harm you. And for a man that was living in battles and for loot, this was fine. Being a loner, Tim did not hurry to join any gang though he knew he wouldn’t be able to survive in this chaos for long. But then it dawned on him: why run and fight the chaos if one can become a part of this same chaos?

So after some thought, he decided to join the battle arenas as an independent fighter and survive on his own.

It was in the arenas that he met Ghost who brought him over to renegades and showed him the power of implants.

!ATTENTION!

It is not known how exactly the two met, but it seems that they bonded over the similarity in their personalities.

!ATTENTION!

The main fighting forte was taken from Ghost as Hunter liked the possibility of combining his fighting skills with the invisibility implant for maximum effect.

This was how Tim accepted his true self - a greedy anarchist mercenary, up for any well-rewarded job.

‘What is there in the additional info?’

‘I don’t know yet, Tim, but most probably some data connected to you’.

‘OK. Thanks again, Mr. Sterling’.

‘Quid pro quo, Tim’.

The figure in the coat left the room, and the man took the AK, clicked the safety off, and blended into the shadows.

I didn't know Stalker was in cahoots with Ghost all the time! And I didn't know his name was Tim.
