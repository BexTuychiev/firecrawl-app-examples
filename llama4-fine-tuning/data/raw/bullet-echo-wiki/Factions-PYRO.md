**P.Y.R.O.** \- Armed People's Groups, not too coordinated but numerous enough to be ignored, do not favor any of the formed factions because they reject the ideas of technocracy and dictatorship from the old order. They consist of free street fighters, saboteurs, and stalkers who are armed with captured weapons. Sometimes, they receive financial support from unknown sources.
