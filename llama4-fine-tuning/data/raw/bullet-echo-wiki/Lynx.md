Lynx is a unique hero and the only [sniper](https://bullet-echo.fandom.com/wiki/Snipers "Snipers") with a bow. She is able to switch between unique modes.

Her first mode is rapid mode, which grants her high mobility and fire rate at the cost of a wide spread and relatively short range. Her second mode (accessed by pressing what is normally the reload button) is sniper mode, which drastically reduces her mobility and fire rate for a large increase in range and damage as well as having 100% max movement speed while aiming (she will always be in aimed stance unless rotating too fast) and much less spread.

She is also uniquely capable of picking up the foregrip upgrade, whereas all other characters in the sniper class cannot.

### Rain of Arrows\[ [Sign in to edit](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fbullet-echo.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FLynx%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D4&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

Shows a circle that signifies the area that Rain of Arrows will be damaging. This area will slowly move away from the hero until just before the ability runs out. At this point, the Rain of Arrows will commence, giving enemies a short time to leave the area before being damaged by the ability. Pressing the ability button within its active duration will begin the Rain early, usually closer than the maximum distance. Enemies will be able to see where you are aiming the Rain of Arrows with a marker/pin, similar to that of a grenade, thermal vision, shooting, etc.

"This hero aims and brings down a rain of arrows on the enemies below."

#### Part 1\[ [Sign in to edit](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fbullet-echo.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FLynx%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D11&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

It was a planned morning training session, and it was already coming to an end; everything was going as usual.

Cyclops quickly bandaged himself and, about to get up, suddenly froze: there was an arrowhead a mere couple of centimeters from his eye. Moving quickly was out of the question, so Cyclops carefully bent to the side to see who managed to creep up and take him at gunpoint. And he was stunned again. The Corporal recognized Lynx: they served in the same battalion but were in different divisions.

Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, Lynx did not recognize the Corporal, and that was understandable‚Ä¶ After those terrible events in the jungle, his own father would not have recognized him. Lynx‚Äôs past is unknown: no name, no age, nothing about the family. Only bits of information can be gained from those who knew her. It is known that Lynx was lucky to advance through the ranks after the service. So she ended up in a special detachment of the Green Raven's guard. There was a deal: if she proved herself, she could replace the retiring head of security.

Being close to the faction founder and dictator required an impeccable reputation and discipline. One day, when she came to work, they put a bag on her head and threw her to the training ground without saying a word. Lynx knew this would happen sooner or later ‚Äì it was the reckoning for the silence. She had withheld the information about the plot against Green Raven for several months by then. Once Green Raven uncovered the plot, everyone she worked with disappeared. Their existence was wiped off the face of the earth, and their names were instantly forgotten. But killing Lynx would mean that the information about the plot leader would be lost forever. Was he part of the guard, is he alive now, and where is he? Torturing Lynx did not yield any results, and Green Raven did not want to keep her alive for much longer. So he gave the order to have her dossier inspected in search of a clue and to solve the mystery. But the man with the order was killed on the spot, and the killer destroyed the dossier.

Lynx remains a hostage, a model officer is now a common legionary. Green Raven did not take her life, but he made sure to destroy it.

#### Part 2\[ [Sign in to edit](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fbullet-echo.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FLynx%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D12&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

After that unexpected meeting in the Arenas, old memories of his military service have started to disturb Cyclops. Lynx appeared in his head quite often ‚Äì although she was almost no different from the other soldiers.

Nowadays there‚Äôs a bandage covering her face, but back in the days she didn‚Äôt wear anything like that. One day, they were working out at the training grounds, and someone in the distance called her name: _"Valerie!"_\- shouted that person. The voice sounded warm and friendly. So, she was not completely alone, and at least some loyal comrades brightened up her service routine. But time has changed everyone. The person who tried to get to the Lynx‚Äôs dossier is now a scarred corpse lying in the middle of the archive room. The Force & Arms group has thoroughly examined what was left of the poor guy and even scanned every inch of the room. The examination showed that the cause of death was a cardiac arrest and not the physical trauma as it was believed initially. So obviously, the killer who staged the massacre did it either for distraction, or for the sake of intimidation. To make a healthy soldier die from a heart attack and not leave any apparent clues of that ‚Äì only the power of technology can do that.

SkyTech is known for its advanced technology ‚Äì "Perfection has no price" ‚Äì a slogan justifying bloody human experiments. So yes, we are all in SkyTech's pocket: if they don't use you, they are watching you to use someone who‚Äôs beyond their reach for the moment. The traitor who destroyed her dossier has technology on their side and it will be thrice as hard to deal with him compared to anyone else. Someone mighty and influential tries to save Lynx's life, paying no attention to the costs it might bring. But why? Does anyone care about her? On the other hand, it is easy to use Lynx as a puppet with the help of technology, but will she execute an order by coercion or blackmail, even if she gets into such a difficult situation? We'll find out later‚Ä¶
