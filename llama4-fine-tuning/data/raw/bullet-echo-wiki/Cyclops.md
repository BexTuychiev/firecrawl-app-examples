Cyclops has access to the White Marble gear set exclusive to Ambusher Heroes. And his personal gear set the Cyclops Inferno gear set

Available [Upgrades](https://bullet-echo.fandom.com/wiki/Upgrades "Upgrades") for Cyclops are:

- Enchanced Magazine
- Explosive Rounds
- Armor Echancer
- Visor

## Strength and weakness\[ [Sign in to edit](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fbullet-echo.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FCyclops%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D14&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

**Notable strength**:

- Unlike other common ambushers, Cyclops's shotgun has more range due to their invader passive provides +75% aimed fire range and siege expert passive provide +75% aimed movement speed to allies and Cyclops themself.
- The Invader passive allow him to shorten enemy's vision range and firing range in half with a single shot. Giving cyclops more advantage on combat situation as long he hit a first shot
- His siege expert passive allows him to blind anyone on 360 range of radius for 1.8 after a kill or down. Allows him to secure ambushes and grouped enemy
- Decent damage, fire range, fire rate and health

**Notable weakness:**

- Cyclops will be certainly weak without his upgrades and passives. Making him very fragile on weaker lobbies
- Most of the heroes from the [Skytech Megacorp](https://bullet-echo.fandom.com/wiki/Factions/Skytech_Megacorp "Factions/Skytech Megacorp") faction is a counter against Cyclops and so does other heroes from [Force and Arms](https://bullet-echo.fandom.com/wiki/Factions/Force_and_Arms "Factions/Force and Arms") faction
- Cyclops ranged capability is limited due to cyclops needs to slow down its movement or stopped completely.
- The invader passive's fire and vision range reduction is almost useless if the enemy is already very close.
- Cyclops's Siege Expert' buff has less benefit to its teammate due to its being situational.


## Tips and trick\[ [Sign in to edit](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fbullet-echo.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FCyclops%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D15&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

Here are some tips that might affect your gameplay

- If [Precision implant](https://bullet-echo.fandom.com/wiki/Precision_Implant "Precision Implant") was upgraded enough, combining it with Cyclops' Siege expert passive its possible to make cyclops' movement speed while aiming maxed with Cyclops' movement speed without aiming, making you always aiming no matter how fast you're moving the same as [Mirage](https://bullet-echo.fandom.com/wiki/Mirage "Mirage") making aiming easier. But rotating too fast still ruin your aiming state
- Watch out for armored enemies, One of cyclops weakness is armor because Cyclops cannot do full damage to enemy' health
- Always get an armor before you fight
- Use the Scan ability to attack enemies hiding in grasses, the scan ability will reveal enemies hiding in grass making your firing cone able to detect them even from outside grass, allowing you and your allies to shot them
- Canceling scan, after using scan click it again to cancel it it makes your ability to be quickly ready for another use. Canceling scan will not cancel its ability its still function as normal until the timer runs out, it just make the timer bar vanished
- If your playing as team cover your teammate from different side or flank the enemies
- Use covers to protect yourself from incoming attacks, but watch out for high pierce heroes

**"Another day... Another task... Another battle... Nature is just a long war for survival..."**

Corporal Calum McManus of the 77th Dublin Infantry Battalion was raised alone by a single father in the dense forests of Central Europe. Growing up, he was taught to be resourceful and to make do with whatever nature provided. Crafting, tracking, and hunting were the tools of his trade, and the young boy became intimately familiar with the kick of a buckshot round from his father's shotgun. When his father died, he moved back into Ireland in an attempt to connect with his ancestral roots. With the country's woodlands all but gone, there wasn't much place for a man of his abilities. Thus, he enlisted with the military where his quick-thinking, resourcefulness, and skill with firearms earned him the role of a close-quarters specialist. Armed with an automatic shotgun, he and his squad cleared dozens of buildings and scores of sectors from terrorists and rebels throughout their service. For a while, Calum thought he had found his place among his people until the Taoiseach of Ireland began approving various "Peacekeeping Missions" in foreign lands. Thousands of Irish soldiers died overseas, protecting corrupt governments who did not care what happened to them. It was no secret that the Taoiseach was under the power of the growing megacorporations and was undermining Irish power and stability to have the country sold to the highest bidder. Soon it was Calum's turn to be thrown into the meat grinder.

He was deployed in a foreign jungle, among people who did not even speak the same language, and caught in a bloody ambush that almost caused Calum to drown in a river as he fled from the insurgents. Losing most of his supplies in the water, he decided the mission could screw itself. His only goal now was to survive and make it back to their Forward Operating Base.

**"Civilization...? Power...? Normalcy...? Empty concepts made by cowards and weaklings so that the strong will die in their stead... "**

Other than the rebels, the tropical jungle was crawling with all manner of parasites and predators. Days were spent on long walks, keeping his eyes and ears open and carefully navigating through the trees. Nights were spent in tense paranoia, trying to get minutes of fitful sleep and shielding himself from rain. He had even fashioned himself a makeshift Ghillie Suit from nearby plants. Eventually, his food stores ran low, and he was having poor luck in finding animals to hunt. Calum felt lucky when he saw smoke coming from a village until he saw the armed men that walked within and realized that the rebels owned the place. However, he did not intend to give up after getting so far.

**"... Only out here... Only in the roar of battle does nature speak clearly..."**

Under the cover of night, he crept in. He killed one guard with his knife and grabbed an isolated man, held them at gunpoint, and asked "Food! Where is the food?!" The scared man did not understand until Calum made eating gestures. When he pointed at a specific house, he knocked him out with the butt of his shotgun and quietly ran for it. Once inside, he quickly stuffed all the water and food items he could carry inside his repaired backpack when he saw a little girl staring at him. They looked at each other in disbelief for a moment. Then the child started screaming.

Calum dropped the food in his hands and quickly ran for the girl, wrapping her in his arms. He knew they had heard her, and he had to leave now. This girl was his best chance of survival. He held her by the neck and dragged her outside.

**"I HAD to survive... And if the girl was smart... She would have lived too..."**

Men and women, some of whom were armed, all came running out of their huts and saw a man covered in leaves and with wild eyes holding a child at gunpoint with a dirty shotgun. "STAY BACK!" Calum shouted. If they did not understand, he shouted louder and shook the girl and his gun. Every time someone tried to approach, he would shout at them, and if one of them tried pointing a weapon at him, he would press the shotgun so hard against the girl's head she would start crying out. He did this the whole time as he walked out of the village. Once he managed to put distance between him and the people there, he shoved the girl away and ran into the shadows of the jungle.

In the safety of darkness, he checked on the supplies he had managed to steal. He was not happy with the amount, but he hoped it would be enough to get him home. That was when he heard the plane engines.

Looking up, he saw the streaks of jet fighters against the stars in the sky. He only had a second to wonder about their mission, when he heard the familiar sound of screaming missiles. The ground shook and the night was lit up in an orange inferno as missiles slammed into the trees. Calum saw the jungle and the village he just came from becoming engulfed in flames a mere second before he ran for his life.

At first, the screaming was in the distance, then it came from his own mouth as fire and smoke began surrounding him. His muscles burned as hard as his skin the whole time he ran until his legs gave out. Then he crawled as long as his arms would listen to him. Smoke filled his lungs and he felt chemicals burning his skin and eyes.

He would have fought death until his last breath, but it was not meant to be his final day.

**"My superiors thought it'd be better if I were dead... These people promised not only life... But my eyes too... There was no choice"**

Calum woke up blind, and being told that while his body was saved, his lungs were damaged, and he would never see again. He was found by an assault squad and healed until his superiors decided they couldn't afford a witness to the firebombing. A strange visitor came to his hospital bed then and said his organization would have a use for a man of his determination and let slip that he would be listed as MIA within the week. The man told him they would grant him sight greater than he had known if he swore an oath to obey the will of their "Great Leader".

Calum knew what his government would do to him if he stayed. The men in power had killed for less. He refused to be part of their body count. He was a survivor, and he would do whatever it took to be the last man standing.

In the night, he was whisked away on a discreet transport, placed on a plane to God knows where, and laid down on a new hospital bed, where many strange voices told him that he would see everything as it truly was. The following days were spent in a blind haze of sedatives and pain as tools invaded his skull. Occasionally, the strange voices by his bedside would speak in languages unknown to him, chanting the same words, sometimes for hours. Calum lost track of how long he was kept there until the bandages were removed from his face, and a lone voice told him to open his eye.

**"My sight... My body... My life... None of it was mine anymore. To continue to survive, I had to become a weapon... Their weapon... HIS weapon..."**

At first, seeing again was painfully bright, and he could not bear to open it for long, but through medicine and therapy it got easier, and the headaches would fade faster. Soon, the new eye somehow started making use of his old ones if it wanted more sight lines, transferring the odd yellow glow to his dead white eyes. They told him they had given him his life and his sight back. Calum knew none of it was his any more, but surprisingly he did not mind. These people not only saved him from certain death but restored his vision and promised him a place of prominence among them. His loyalty was a fair price.

He was no longer Corporal Calum McManus, and he did not want anyone to recognize him as such. He hid every part that hinted at his old life. Now, he was an ogre of the wilds, an Oni of the woods, a primal force that was neither good nor evil, but a reminder of the natural order, a member of a pack of predators who simply abided by the survival of the fittest.

Force and Arms did not just recruit a soldier, they summoned a Cyclops.
