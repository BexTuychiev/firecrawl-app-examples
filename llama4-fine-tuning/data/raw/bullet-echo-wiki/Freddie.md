_Note: This page is still in development. Information might be approximative or lacking_

_Note: Here a quick description or in-game hero Card Info._

The quintessential "glass cannon" of Bullet Echo, Freddie has access to major damage output and can attain incredible speeds, but only after he takes damage. This fact, coupled with the lowest armor out of any hero in the game, means Freddie has very little survivability but can melt even tanks with ease. His active throws a grenade, his medical is Stim, his first passive is Street Fighter and his team passive is Influence.

Freddie can be unlocked by opening [chests](https://bullet-echo.fandom.com/wiki/Chests "Chests").

[Freddie's Lore posted by JK Eff on Discord on 2021-01-26 \| Written by N\|KSA](https://discord.com/channels/520268917659402241/703180906696933387/803619382206136365)

Explosion. This was not the first and far from the last explosion in Freddie's life. Entering through the resulting hole into the building of the abandoned laboratory, he bent over from a painful convulsion. He needed medicine, and even though this building had been abandoned long ago, he somehow knew that he would find what he needed here. Walking along the abandoned corridors, Freddie searched box after box, but there was nothing anywhere. Deciding to look for some documents, Freddie went into one of the rooms - a table, a couple of cabinets, a computer - an ordinary-looking room, but something was wrong in it. After pausing on the threshold for a second, Freddie entered the room, and his gaze fell on a small book under the table. Some strange feeling bound him, a strange memory ..... But a new attack of pain quickly drove away all feelings. He needed the medicine. Having decided to look in it for a mention of what he needed, Freddie picked up the book and opened it in the middle.

> 19.10. Experiments on the Vz7 method begin today. We’ve received many test subjects, they said they were volunteers. Many of them were apparently damaged by fire, but that doesn't really matter. The first group of test subjects was too weak, none survived even a small dose of radiation. With the second group of volunteers, we achieved a bit better results. However, the subjects died quickly after the serum injection. I never thought that we would achieve at least some results in such a short time.

> 22.10 For several days, the test subjects have not shown any results. The technique had to be changed. As it turned out, the constant administration of serum makes the body used to it faster. Yes, the test subjects take a lot of resources, but this is at least some kind of progress. However, after exposure, most die within a few days.

> 01.10 Incredible! One of the test subjects, a certain John Seifer, has lived for several days. He has even shown improved metabolism in tests. The burn wounds are almost healed, I think he will be the key to solving our problem. Several new ones did the same today, one of them, Robert, seems to be unaware of what we are doing.

> 02.10 No matter how hard we try, John is also dying. I think another course of therapy will help him, the main thing is that he does not destroy everything again. Today, several test subjects died due to the mistakes of newbies, I believe there won’t be enough experimental subjects at this rate by the time the experiment is completed.

> 03.10 My fears came true, our only successful experiment was Seifer. He thrashed the room and got a bullet in the head. Bloody newbies! Half of them do not come, and the other half are complete idiots. 13.10 The experiment seems to be doomed to failure. The test subjects run out, Vz7 does not show the desired results, many of the scientists fail to show up. Today I discovered a subject who looked oddly like Robert. I did not see him before the radiation, his face was burned too much. He didn't survive the serum injection anyway.

Freddie was torn from reading by another convulsion. It was not what he needed, and there was less and less time left, but why does it all seem so familiar to him…. He had no time to think about it now. He leafed through the book to the end and froze, a long-standing memory awakening in his head.

> 13.11 This is most likely my last entry. My fears were confirmed. Scientists are indeed used as test subjects! They have already come for me…. will my own research be used on me? I already hid the prototype of the drug, but I think they will find it ...

What is this? Why is this so familiar? Freddie, acting on a memory that he didn’t actually remember, went to the second floor. He broke down the door of cell no. 33, and he saw something that caused him a new attack of pain, though not physical this time. He was in the procedure room for the Vz7 experiment. He knew it for sure, it was here that he became who he is now. Freddie started rummaging through the documents on the table: John Seifer - no. Robert Vann - no. Here it is. Freddie froze again a folder labeled ‘Frederick Evans’ in his hands. The folder with a description of the experiment performed on him. A new attack of pain stopped him from opening it. He must find the answers, find out who he is, but he needs the medicine first. He attached the mask to the gas tank by the wall and took a deep breath. A vague sense of doubt gripped him, but it was too late. The healing gas spread through Freddie’s body as he recalled:

> 10.11 Finally, a new breakthrough! The drug I created extends the lives of the test subjects, it has already been tested. Although almost all lose the ability to speak, many lose sight and for almost all, memories are erased by the deteriorating brain activity, they survive! But a soldier doesn't need to think. The main thing is to live.

Freddie shook his head. And what was he so worried about just now? Probably about the medicine. With the tank on his back and the mask on his face, Freddie blew up another wall and went out into the street. He should return to the Pyros, and find out about those recruiting Arenas. They offer health improvements and all that. Maybe they'll take him on?

### Mentioned in Doc's Lore\[ [Sign in to edit](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fbullet-echo.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FFreddie%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D11&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

[Doc's Lore with Freddie as honorable mention posted by JK Eff on Discord on 2020-09-08 \| Written by Roamer](https://discord.com/channels/520268917659402241/703180906696933387/752875840064323584)

Captain Ray Harris of the United States Medical Corps was a capable physician, serving as a combat medic for several years before being severely injured on one of his tours of duty, receiving some burns to his face after an encounter with an incendiary grenade. He retired from the battlefield and instead was sent to be a physician on a panel tasked with testing new armaments before they were considered for use by the army.

In his new job, Doc saw horrible new weapons, most of them designed by Skytech, that he knew should never see use against human beings... nonetheless, many of these weapons did make it to the field. Doc's breaking point came when a new type of incendiary weapon was developed and sent to be inspected by the panel. Skytech, being the creators of this new devastating new type of ammunition, saw it fit to test it on live human subjects, selected from their many indentured servants. Despite his many objections, the test went without a hitch, and Doc saw firsthand how devastating this new weapon could be. The explosive rounds were tested for direct impact and close-range detonation, leaving just one of the test subjects still in one piece. After the trials, Doc felt that it was his moral imperative to see what he could do to ease the peoples' pains.

When he went to inspect the bodies, he came across the one living test subject, a man named Freddie. He was covered in burns and scars, and was in pitiful condition. He likely had just hours to live. Doc decided at that moment that he would attempt to save the man's life. He took Freddie from the testing area in secret and transported him to a hospital, where he personally performed a surgery that would save Freddie's life. Though the incident resulted in nerve damage and permanent burns, Doc was able to restore motor function and fix most of the life-threatening issues.

Shortly after this, Doc decided to quit the panel and the military all together, instead joining the Pyro faction along with Freddie and donning his trademark gas mask as a homage to all those that died or were injured due to devastating new weapons of war like he had.

### Mentioned in Sparkle's Lore\[ [Sign in to edit](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fbullet-echo.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FFreddie%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D12&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")\]

[Sparkle's Lore with Freddie as honorable mention posted by JK Eff on Discord on 2021-10-12 \| Written by Fahad "foxmindedguy" Kazi](https://discord.com/channels/520268917659402241/703180906696933387/819927443556794388)

She sat quietly in a small conference room across the table from two peculiar figures - one wearing a gas mask and the other hooked up to an oxygen tank. Every time her line of sight would meet theirs, she would quickly look away nervously. Her knee too was shaking constantly ever since she first took a seat.

"Ms. Visser, you have nothing to be afraid of", said the man in the gas mask. His voice sounded genuine and calming.

"Femke... You can call me by my first name... Femke", she spoke, clearing her throat between the statements.

"Alright, Femke. Please tell us how can we help you", replied the gas mask man once more before relaxing back on his chair with arms folded, waiting to listen to her story.

"I work...", she paused briefly before correcting herself, "worked at the Hope Orphanage. There, I used to teach children carpentry and spray painting to get their minds off the stresses of their predicament. I wanted to show them that they were all extremely talented, and that they could build, be creative, no matter what life threw at them. Adoption rates were slow but we were finding good homes for these children, so they could be loved and cared for. Until our CEO signed a contract with Unity Incorporated. This organization claimed that nuclear family was no longer a necessity for striving kids but instead children needed strong mentors to build their confidence and character. It was an academy of sorts - a boarding school or a summer camp, if you will. I was a bit skeptical about this program but if it could better the lives of these poor orphans who felt finding a parent was a competition and would constantly endure getting passed up until they were chosen, then I was not going to say anything…

...Within a week, their people came in droves and took all the kids who wanted to leave with them. Things seemed great for a little while until I was visited by a strange teenager named Felipe Garcia. This child had hollow eyes and would not speak. He left a note with me that had the address of one of the facilities of Unity Incorporated. The letter also instructed me to go unannounced. And that is exactly what I did".

She continued after taking a sip of water from the glass cup in front of her, "I saw... Children strapped down with needles and syringes in various places of their body... Some emerged in flooded containers of what appeared to be a breathable fluid... Other horrors I can't even describe".

As she recalled what else she witnessed, she grew quiet and started to slightly fidget uncomfortably.

"Carry on, Ms. Visser", said the man in the gas mask; leaning forward in interest and anticipation.

"As I stood there, frozen in disbelief and completely shocked at what we had unknowingly allowed - a guard noticed my presence. I don't remember what happened next but when I came to - I had a shotgun in my hand, probably the guards, and the entire work crew in that vicinity laid on the floor with their guts splattered everywhere", she uttered before going silent again. Her eyes withdrawn and her head anchored downward in shame.

"Sparkle!", yelled the guy with the oxygen tank to snap her out of the guilt-ridden dark place where she seemed to be headed.

"Excuse me?", said Femke, a little confused about the word.

"Please do not mind Freddie", interjected the gas mask man, "He has gone through something really terrible, which makes it difficult for him to speak, and sometimes he blurts out words uncontrollably".

"That's alright", nodded Femke in acknowledgment at Freddie's remark.

"So, Ms. Visser, how can we help you?", asked the gas mask man once more.

"I need your protection. I read that P.Y.R.O. specializes in handling tricky situations like mine. Unity Incorporated is after me because I am a threat, I know the crimes they have committed, and I can leak it to the world. But who would believe me... I am a mass murderer and any person in my position would make up any story to protect themselves. However, I also have all the children they were experimenting on, and they are after them as well. Now I don't care much about whether I live or die - I just don't want these precious souls to get hurt further", demanded Femke with a surety in her voice that was largely absent through their past conversation.

After a brief moment of pause, the gas mask man took off his mask to reveal his face and then said, "I can do you one better. How would you like to join P.Y.R.O. and together we can take on Unity Incorporated - decimating them from the face of this planet for all their misdeeds".

He then looked towards Freddie and proceeded to say to Femke, "And I suppose your call-sign can be Sparkle; for you have always been the glimmer of hope in the lives of the children under your wing".
