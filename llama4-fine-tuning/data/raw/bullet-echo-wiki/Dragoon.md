World-class athlete turned resistance fighter, Magnus Johannessen‚Äôs government oppressed its people, gaining military power and influence throughout the world on the backs of its poor laborers, who lived in extreme poverty. Magnus was drafted into his country‚Äôs super-soldier program in his mid-twenties and injected with a cocktail of powerful drugs without his knowledge. The chemicals were meant to boost his physical prowess, a way for the government to create superhumans. He soon became the nation‚Äôs fiercest competitor, winning his small home country several gold medals in a multitude of events, including the long and high jump, before it was revealed that he had been under the influence of powerful drugs.

When the drugs that had been given to him were discovered by the global community, his country disowned him and sent him to a labor camp, stripping him of any social and financial status he had ever possessed. There, he grew both in strength and mind, flushing most of the chemicals from his system and escaping by jumping over the prison wall. Ready to fight back against those who had done this to him, he joined up with a resistance group that had ties to the Renegades. There, he whipped the would-be revolutionaries into shape, leading them to overthrow the government and destroy their legacy of terror, bringing the nation into a new era of self-rule and anarchy.

Afterward, he caught the attention of the Renegade‚Äôs leadership and was invited to join the main faction, an invitation which he accepted now that he realized the importance of people‚Äôs freedoms on a global scale. Using his specialized set of skills and extraordinary strength, he became a mainstay of the organization, well-respected by all those who belonged to it and most outside of it, making one of the faction‚Äôs prime candidates for the Echo program.

...BOOM! Bullets flying every where, grenades being thrown, strange sounds coming from nowhere and I don't even know how those bullet holes got there, but ah I'm getting too ahead of myself, names Magnus...Magnus Johannessen. So, I'm going to start out by saying that iconic movie line...what was that again? Oh right, this \*shows a crouching Dragoon behind debris\*, is me. Your probably wondering how I got here, why I am here, or who is that? \*shows a wounded Stalker in the arms of Dragoon\* well he's not that important to the story, but I'll tell you anyway.

That's Stalker, my 'colleague' so to say on our mission here, to steal some important items from the lab that started this whole Mimicry outbreak. We and other groups not even from our faction managed to hold them here in this facility, and have been keeping this a secret from the world ever since. but enough about that, I had a mission to do, stuff to steal, though never really liked doing it too much, \*Mimic noises and a Mimic shadow incoming\* oop that's my cue \*fires gun and stops after a second\*. \*screen shakes horizontally\* Oh? you want to know more about me?

Welp my side of the story in this great faction war happened the moment I was born, I was raised by a captain, Boris Johannessen \*zooms to a big strong man who's face is covered with a black beanie and black mask\* who took part in the faction war, he had ties to several other factions, two being the P.Y.R.O. and Renegades coincidentally. After my finding, he immediately took me in and loved me as a father, he also taught me a lot of things when I was a kid and noticed something about me. I was always the strong and fast kid in my class-well not really a class, more like a seasoned war camp for the Renegades. And the easy way to say this without making you think I'm a braggart or think that I think I'm better than everybody else, was that I stood out from the rest, I was only 12 years old at that time, \*show the inside of a tent where young Dragoon and several teachers are talking to his adoptive father\* and the 'teachers' said I have extroardinary human abilities, extremely strong, fast, fast learner, and other things.

Though I never really wanted to believe it, I was chosen as number one of our class, the elitest of the elites, which I thought was ridiculous, I mean come on look at Gary! \*shows a slightly smaller person beside Dragoon\* He's always the braver one, but I guess nature chooses random things. After only 1 year of camp, \*happy Dragoon teenager birthday for him :D\* which my father said was enough since he said I knew so much so fast for my age, I was sent out to live in the woods \*shows green and bright woods with a green landscape\*...with my father, come on, he's not that cruel, if you think he's kinda cruel, I think my dad's pretty awesome! And glass half full...or half empty depending on how you look at it, I made some friends too! \*shows shocked Boris in camping suits, and Dragoon riding on a big bear, and a few hawks and snakes riding on his shoulders and neck\*.

Aaaaand after finishing survival lessons \*hunting with bears in river banks\*, cooking lessons \*out-performing the top chef in a kitchen with everyone amazed\*, building lessons \*build's his gun in the game\* and other lessons I was finally 20 years old! Father said he would be with the Renegade's top leaders for a decade or more, which was the day I was sad, but I was happy for him that he got a promotion! "Hope you have good meeting!" \*shows younger Dragoon saying goodbye to him leaving on a boat\*. "Nothing ever seems to bring down your spirits on any day doesn't it?" \*shows older Gary beside Dragoon\* "What's to be sad about? My dad got a promotion and this is the perfect time to have new and different experiences! Everyone wins!". \*shows laughing Gary\* "Hahahahahaaaa! I'll never understand you Maggy"

When I was 22 now, I received an urgent mission to infiltrate a Skytech Megacorp base and steal some secret files, which I was excited about, being my first elite mission after all. That's when things started to go wrong, my group's walkie-talkies were jammed and we didn't have communication, we then...sorta...got blasted, yeah...that's the word I'll go for. Gary, who was assigned with me on this mission was badly wounded, and no one else in sight I had to be very quiet to get us outta here. Fortunately we got out of there, until one of the guards spotted us and shot at us with a rocket launcher, but something else happened...the moment I looked at that fired rocket, I felt an unstoppable adrenaline in my body, like a lightning struck me but I could feel all the electricity and energy flow through me slowly but was very powerful. \*shows Dragoon jumping 50 feet in the air\* And then I jumped, higher than I thought I could ever reach, and while I was jumping, I looked at all the guards faces, just staring at me in astonishment. Looks like they can't do that 'Operation Husk' everyone was talking about any time soon.

Gary was still unconscious, and I had to take him to the hospital that belonged to Renegade territory. \*show a hospital with an unconscious Gary lying on the bed\* A few days while he was in bed and \*show Dragoon sitting outside the room\* I was outside his room. A strange man approached me, turns out he was one of my father's colleagues and one of the highest ranking leaders in the Renegades, I quickly bowed to him, and as I looked up he smiled. "You really are extroardinary". Turns out most of the Renegades knew about my jumping feat through a drone, and he gave me the rank of 'Supreme Leader', the third highest rank within the Renegades. I stood there, frozen and stunned, he quickly laughed, knocking me out of my trance, oh man if father looks at me now I'm sure that he'll be happy! "Everyone knows how well you handled the 'Skytech Infiltration' mission, even under heavy fire and the last person left, you managed to not only cripple the faction's monopoly severely, but also performed something not humanely possible" The man chuckles.

I then talked to a man nicknamed 'Doc' they said he had contacts with the P.Y.R.O faction, so I had to stay low when I was talking to him in the hospital. "So, what was your...case? Was it?" "Yeah Doc, I...I don't know how to explain it but \*shows video recording of his jump\* I just jumped 50 feet or more in the air". Doc then looked shocked and amazed, but also scared...I think he knows what I was doing before that jump, or at least knows a Skytech Megacorp base when he sees one, but he had acted calm, good thing because even I couldn't tell after a few seconds. "Alright I-I think I'll deal with this matter another time" I knew exactly what he was thinking, he was scared that he was in this knew position, treating someone who had a bad case with Skytech M. Well after that I went off to do some 'homework'

So here I am, age 35, doing my little Mimic mission with my good ol' pal Stalker. \*several mimic noises and shadows\* Woah! I can't tell you anything else, sorry! Gotta Blink! \*Dragoon jumps away with Stalker in his hands\*.

"No matter the mission, no matter how high the cost may be...\*shows imprisoned Boris with a picture of him and Dragoon\* you will always have...a proud father...\*shows the picture to the screen and then a shadow approaches\*". "I think your son would be a be a good fit for the Echo program, wouldn't he?" \*shadow reveals it's Mr. Sterling and other agents\*

I thought Dragoon plays hypixel skyblock not fight to the death in an arena.
