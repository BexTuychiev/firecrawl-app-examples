    "In today's business world, understanding client relationships between companies can provide valuable insights for market research, sales prospecting, and competitive analysis. This article will guide you through building a powerful application that automatically discovers and visualizes client relationships by intelligently scraping company websites using Firecrawl, organizing the data into a hierarchical tree structure, and presenting it through an interactive visualization powered by Streamlit and PyVis. Whether you're a business analyst looking to map industry connections or a developer interested in creating insightful data visualizations, this project combines web scraping, data processing, and interactive visualization techniques into a practical, real-world application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this tutorial, we'll walk through each component of the system step by step, from setting up the semantic web scraping with Firecrawl to recursively building client relationship trees and creating an intuitive user interface with Streamlit. You'll learn how to extract structured client data from unstructured web content, implement efficient tree traversal algorithms, transform hierarchical data into interactive network graphs, and package everything into a polished web application that users can easily interact with. By the end of this article, you'll have a complete, deployable application that can generate comprehensive client relationship visualizations for any company with just a few clicks."

    "## High-level Overview of the Application\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've outlined what we'll be building, let's explore how the different pieces of our application work together. Our client relationship tree application combines several powerful technologies to create a seamless, end-to-end solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of our architecture is Python, which serves as the foundation for all our components. The application consists of four main parts: a web scraper powered by Firecrawl, a tree builder for organizing client relationships, a visualization engine using PyVis and NetworkX, and a user interface built with Streamlit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firecrawl is an AI-powered web scraping API that understands website content beyond just the HTML structure. Unlike traditional web scrapers that need custom rules and code for each website, Firecrawl can identify client information across different website layouts because it understands the meaning of the content. This capability allows our application to work consistently across various company websites without requiring custom configuration for each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The components work together in a pipeline that transforms raw website data into an interactive visualization. When a user enters a company URL in the Streamlit interface, this triggers the ClientScraper to fetch data using Firecrawl. The results are passed to the ClientTreeBuilder, which recursively builds the relationship tree to the specified depth. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the scraper collects client data, the tree builder component organizes it into a hierarchical structure, with each company linking to its clients. This tree is then converted into a network graph using NetworkX and PyVis, which allows for interactive visualization with features like zooming, dragging, and highlighting connections. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Streamlit provides an intuitive web interface where users can input company URLs, adjust settings, and view the resulting relationship graphs without needing to understand the underlying code. \n",
    "\n",
    "All these operations happen behind the scenes, with Streamlit managing the state of the application and displaying appropriate loading indicators while processing occurs. This architecture balances performance with user experience, allowing complex data processing to happen while keeping the interface responsive and easy to use."
