      "answer": "The `maxDepth` option controls how deep the crawler will go when following links. A higher depth allows the crawler to explore more of the site but can result in longer crawl times and more data. For example, setting `maxDepth` to 1 will only crawl the specified URL, while setting it to 3 will allow crawling of links found on the first two levels of pages.\nExample:\n```python\nimport requests\n\nurl = \"https://api.firecrawl.dev/v0/crawl\"\nheaders = {\n    \"Authorization\": \"Bearer your_token\",\n    \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n}\ndata = {\n    \"url\": \"https://example.com\",\n    \"crawlerOptions\": {\n        \"maxDepth\": 3\n    }\n}\n\nresponse = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)\nprint(response.json())```\n\nThis example sets the `maxDepth` to 3, allowing the crawler to follow links up to three levels deep from the initial URL."

      "answer": "Here are some best practices when using Firecrawl's Rust SDK to check crawl job statuses:\n1. **Error Handling**: Always handle errors gracefully to avoid crashes and provide meaningful feedback to users.\n2. **Asynchronous Execution**: Use the `tokio` runtime to ensure that your application remains responsive while waiting for network operations.\n3. **Logging**: Implement logging for successful and failed status checks to help with debugging and monitoring.\n4. **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of API rate limits and implement appropriate backoff strategies if necessary.\n5. **Job Management**: Keep track of job IDs and their statuses to manage multiple crawl jobs effectively.\nHere’s a simple implementation of these practices:\n```rust\nuse firecrawl::FirecrawlApp;\nuse std::time::Duration;\nuse tokio::time::sleep;\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() {\n    let api_key = \"your_api_key_here\";\n    let app = FirecrawlApp::new(api_key);\n\n    let job_id = \"your_job_id_here\";\n\n    for _ in 0..5 {\n        match app.check_crawl_status(job_id).await {\n            Ok(data) => {\n                println!(\"Crawl Status: {}\", data.status);\n                break; // Exit loop on success\n            },\n            Err(e) => {\n                eprintln!(\"Failed to check crawl status: {}\", e);\n                sleep(Duration::from_secs(2)).await; // Wait before retrying\n            },\n        }\n    }\n}```\n\nThis example implements a retry mechanism with a delay, allowing for more robust handling of transient errors."

      "instruction": "How do I handle errors when crawling a website with Firecrawl's Go SDK?",
      "answer": "Error handling is crucial when using the `CrawlUrl` method. You can check for errors after attempting to crawl a URL. Here’s how to do it:\n```go\ncrawlResult, err := app.CrawlURL(\"docs.firecrawl.dev\", crawlParams, true, 2, \"your_idempotency_key\")\nif err != nil {\n    log.Fatalf(\"Failed to crawl URL: %v\", err) // Log the error and terminate\n}\nfmt.Println(crawlResult) // Proceed if no error occurred```\n\nIn this snippet, if an error occurs during the crawl, it will log the error message and terminate the program. This ensures that you are aware of any issues that arise during the crawling process."
    },
    {
      "instruction": "Can I crawl multiple pages with Firecrawl's Go SDK? How?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can crawl multiple pages by adjusting the `limit` parameter in the `crawlerOptions`. Here’s an example that sets a limit of 1000 pages:\n```go\ncrawlParams := map[string]any{\n    \"crawlerOptions\": map[string]any{\n        \"limit\": 1000, // Set to crawl up to 1000 pages\n    },\n}```\n\nBy configuring the `limit`, you can control how many pages Firecrawl will attempt to crawl from the starting URL. This allows for efficient scraping of larger websites."
    },
    {
      "instruction": "How can I ensure that my crawl is idempotent using Firecrawl's Go SDK?",
      "answer": "To ensure idempotency in your crawl requests, you can use the `idempotencyKey` parameter in the `CrawlUrl` method. Here’s how to implement it:\n```go\ncrawlResult, err := app.CrawlURL(\"docs.firecrawl.dev\", crawlParams, true, 2, \"your_idempotency_key\")```\n\nBy providing a unique `idempotencyKey`, you can prevent duplicate crawl jobs from being processed. This is especially useful when you need to retry a crawl without creating multiple entries for the same job."
    },
    {
      "instruction": "How can I check the status of a crawl job using Firecrawl's Go SDK?",
      "answer": "You can check the status of a crawl job by using the `CheckCrawlStatus` method provided by the Firecrawl Go SDK. This method requires the job ID as a parameter and returns the current status of the crawl job. Here's a complete example:\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"log\"\n    \"github.com/firecrawl/firecrawl-go\" // Ensure you have the Firecrawl Go SDK installed\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    app := firecrawl.NewApp(\"your_api_key\")\n    jobId := \"your_job_id\" // Replace with your actual job ID\n\n    status, err := app.CheckCrawlStatus(jobId)\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatalf(\"Failed to check crawl status: %v\", err)\n    }\n    fmt.Println(status)\n}```\n\nIn this example, replace `\"your_api_key\"` with your actual Firecrawl API key and `\"your_job_id\"` with the ID of the crawl job you want to check. The program will print the current status of the crawl job or log an error if the status check fails."

      "instruction": "Can I use Firecrawl's Go SDK to check the status of multiple crawl jobs at once?",
      "answer": "The Firecrawl Go SDK does not provide a built-in method for checking multiple crawl job statuses simultaneously. However, you can implement this functionality using goroutines for concurrency. Here's an example:\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"log\"\n    \"sync\"\n    \"github.com/firecrawl/firecrawl-go\" // Ensure you have the Firecrawl Go SDK installed\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    app := firecrawl.NewApp(\"your_api_key\")\n    jobIds := []string{\"job_id_1\", \"job_id_2\", \"job_id_3\"} // Replace with your actual job IDs\n\n    var wg sync.WaitGroup\n    for _, jobId := range jobIds {\n        wg.Add(1)\n        go func(id string) {\n            defer wg.Done()\n            status, err := app.CheckCrawlStatus(id)\n            if err != nil {\n                log.Printf(\"Failed to check crawl status for job %s: %v\", id, err)\n                return\n            }\n            fmt.Printf(\"Crawl Status for job %s: %s\\n\", id, status)\n        }(jobId)\n    }\n    wg.Wait()\n}```\n\nIn this example, we use goroutines to check the status of multiple crawl jobs concurrently. Each job ID is processed in its own goroutine, and we use a `sync.WaitGroup` to wait for all goroutines to finish before exiting the program."

You can customize the actions taken for each status based on your application's needs."
    },
    {
      "instruction": "What is the best practice for checking crawl job status in Firecrawl's Go SDK?",
      "answer": "A best practice for checking crawl job status is to implement a retry mechanism in case of transient errors. Here's an example of how to do this:\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"log\"\n    \"time\"\n    \"github.com/firecrawl/firecrawl-go\" // Ensure you have the Firecrawl Go SDK installed\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    app := firecrawl.NewApp(\"your_api_key\")\n    jobId := \"your_job_id\" // Replace with your actual job ID\n    maxRetries := 3\n    var status string\n    var err error\n\n    for i := 0; i < maxRetries; i++ {\n        status, err = app.CheckCrawlStatus(jobId)\n        if err == nil {\n            break\n        }\n        log.Printf(\"Attempt %d: Failed to check crawl status: %v\", i+1, err)\n        time.Sleep(2 * time.Second) // Wait before retrying\n    }\n\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatalf(\"All attempts failed: %v\", err)\n    }\n    fmt.Println(\"Crawl Status:\", status)\n}```\n\nIn this example, we attempt to check the crawl job status up to three times, waiting two seconds between each attempt. This helps to handle transient errors gracefully and ensures that you get the latest status of the crawl job."

If the page does not respond within this time frame, the operation will be aborted."
    },
    {
      "instruction": "How does the timeout setting affect the performance of scraping operations in Firecrawl?",
      "answer": "The timeout setting directly affects the performance and reliability of scraping operations. A longer timeout allows the scraper to wait for slow-loading pages, which can be beneficial for scraping content from websites that may take time to load. However, it can also lead to longer wait times if the page is unresponsive.\nConversely, a shorter timeout can speed up the scraping process by quickly aborting requests to unresponsive pages. It's important to balance the timeout setting based on the expected load times of the target websites. Here's an example of a balanced approach:\n```python\nfrom firecrawl import FirecrawlApp\n\napp = FirecrawlApp(api_key='your_api_key')\n\n# Set a balanced timeout of 15 seconds (15000 milliseconds)\ndata = app.scrape_url('https://example.com', {\n    'timeout': 15000,  # 15 seconds\n    'formats': ['markdown', 'html']\n})\n\nprint(data)```\n\nIn this example, a 15-second timeout is set, which may be suitable for many websites, allowing for a reasonable wait time without excessively prolonging the scraping process."

    {
      "instruction": "What are the benefits of using gzip compression for storing scraped data?",
      "answer": "Using gzip compression can significantly reduce the file size of your stored data, which helps optimize disk space usage. This is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets. The `DataManager` class in the example above allows you to choose whether to compress the data when saving it."
    },
    {
      "instruction": "How can I organize my scraped data by date using the DataManager class?",
      "answer": "The `DataManager` class organizes data by appending the current date to the filename when saving. This way, each day's scraped products are stored in a separate file, making it easy to track and retrieve historical data. The filenames follow the format `ph_products_YYYY_MM_DD.json` or `ph_products_YYYY_MM_DD.json.gz`."
    },
    {
      "instruction": "How do I handle loading data from both compressed and uncompressed files?",
      "answer": "The `load_products` method in the `DataManager` class checks for the existence of a compressed file first. If it finds the `.gz` file, it loads data from there; otherwise, it checks for the uncompressed `.json` file. This ensures that you can retrieve your data regardless of the storage format used."
    },
    {
      "instruction": "What are some best practices for managing scraped data storage?",
      "answer": "Best practices include:\n- Use compression (like gzip) to save disk space.\n- Organize data by date for easy retrieval.\n- Implement error handling when loading files to manage missing data gracefully.\n- Regularly clean up old data if it's no longer needed to free up storage.\n- Use consistent naming conventions for files to avoid confusion."
